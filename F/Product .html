            <h1>CORDON BLEU</h1>
            <p>The purpose of our business is to provide the customers with a quality meal that could satisfy their hunger without compromising their budget. It appeals to all customers because Cordon Bleu is a simple dish and can be easily recognized by students of all levels. The most evident feature of our product is its size. The regular-sized Cordon Bleu has been downsized to the size of little balls, with different sauces that enhance its flavor. Its simple and recognizable taste would feel like home with its familiar cheesiness, the crispy breadcrumbs, the tasty chicken and ham. Its small size may also appeal to little children. Due to its size, we decided to call it “Baby Bleu”. We offer three different sauces which the customers can choose from: cheese, spicy cheese and creamy garlic.</p>
